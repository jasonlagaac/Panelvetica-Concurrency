## About StatusPad
StatusPad is an iPad allows people to keep up with the latest news, weather, their schedule and time at specific timezones.

## Why I created StatusPad
I recently got an iPad for my birthday from my lovely wife :) After using it for a while, I had to switch back to my computer to do something else. This lead me to think, when I was using my main computer, my iPad would just sit there, useless and doing nothing. So I figured, why not
create an app that will allow me to keep up with the world and also what I have scheduled for today :) Win Win!

## Why I am proud of StatusPad
I am really proud of this app because it allowed me to experiment with the lower level workings for the iOS user interface and work with other frameworks (such as Three20 and the new iOS 5 Twitter plugins). I found StatusPad to be a useful product which sought out to fixed my own personal problem and I hope (WHEN it does get released) it'll be of some use to other people out there.
