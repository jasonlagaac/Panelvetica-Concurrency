## About StatusPad
StatusPad is an iPad allows people to keep up with the latest news, weather, their schedule and time at specific timezones.

## Why I created StatusPad
I recently got an iPad for my birthday from my lovely wife :) and after using it for a while, I had to switch back to my computer to do something else. This lead me to think, when I was using my main computer, my iPad would just sit there, useless and doing nothing. So I figured, why not
create an app that will allow me to keep up with the world and also what I have scheduled for today :) Win Win!

## Why I am proud of StatusPad
I am really proud of this app because it allowed me to play around with the lower level workings for the iOS user interface objects and other frameworks like Three20 and the new iOS 5 twitter plugins. I also found StatusPad to be a useful product which fixed my own personal problem and, in a way, I also hope it'll be of some use to other people out there.
